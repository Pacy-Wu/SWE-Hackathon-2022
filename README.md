# Health Checker
##  Introduction:
    Most of us have experience feeling sick or having symptoms and not knowing what went wrong. We try to search online and quickly get overwhelmed by walls of text on all the webpages. The main feature of this app is to let the user learn about what might be causing the symptoms they are experiencing based on some basic information of the user and their input of symtoms, and what specialisation of healthcare services they should see based on the suggested issue. Some features that have not been implemented includes a simple BMI calculator and a dashboard that displays featured health-related news.
